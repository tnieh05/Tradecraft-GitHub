                            <p>There are two main challenges to address: How to pivot focus from the marketplace to their payment platform feature and how can we provide the right messaging to target the different groups that use their site? </p>

                    <h4>1. User Research</h4>
                    <br>
                        <p>Because one of the main goals was to change the messaging on their landing page, user research was an extremely important part of the process. We needed to thoroughly understand their different target markets and find out what their needs were. </p>
                    <br>
                        <p>WeTravel had three main existing personas that they wanted us to focus on:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Semi-Professionals: Usually yoga instructors or MBA students</li>
                            <li>Professionals: Boutique agencies</li>
                            <li>DMC's (Destination Management Company): Large companies that are harder to onboard but rely on the payment platform which results in more revenue for WeTravel. </li>
                        </ul>
                </div>

                        <p> I decided to focus on two main problems: locating and deleting bookmarks. Using the information from the research, I created two personas that were typical of the users that I interviewed whom were mostly students or young professionals. Creating a persona allowed me to think in their shoes and implement changes in ways they see fit. I also created a scenario as that allowed me to fully immerse myself in a situation and think visually. </p>
