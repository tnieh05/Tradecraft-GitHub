                    <h3>Cycle 4</h3>
                    <br>
                        <p>Because we met our goal, we thought we could fine tune it a little more and hopefully reach a 100% success rate.</p>
                        <h4>Hypothesis</h4>
                        <p>If we emphasize the benefit of passing the processing fee on, then 100% of users can correctly explain the cost to use WeTravel.
                        </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Users were confused about which fee to pass on (transaction fee or processing fee?)
                        </li>
                        <li>Users felt deceived by the "save more" wording</li>
                        <li>Users did not like that the example was written out in words and preferred a visual representation</li>
                     </ul>
                    </div>
                    <h4>Results</h4>
                    <p>60% of users understood the pricing</p>
                    <h3>Takeaways</h3>   
                    <p>Because cycle 4 was less successful than cycle 3, we reverted back to cycle 3 for our final prototype. </p>
