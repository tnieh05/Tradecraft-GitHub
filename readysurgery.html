                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p> Ready surgery is a comprehensive tool utilized by surgeons to reduce surgical complications by evaluating a patient's surgical candidacy using their history and vitals. Our goal is to improve the UX flow of this progressive web app on ios.</p>

                        <p>As part of our user research process, we sought to understand the work flow of surgical centers. Our research consisted of shadowing surgeons and schedulers from different hospitals around the Bay area. We analyzed their interactions with other staff members, saw how they allocated their time and observed them using the Ready Surgery tool. </p>
                    <br>
                        <p>In addition to on-site research, we also conducted interviews with various people in the healthcare industry to gain additional perspectives.</p>

                    <h4>Affinity Mapping</h4>
                    
                        <p>We created affinity maps to help us make sense of the pain points centered around surgery clinics and the Ready Surgery app. We were able to determine that improving the "Risk Report" page would create the biggest impact for the surgeon and scheduler.</p>
                    
                        <h4>What is the risk page?</h4>
                        <p>Surgeons use the Risk Page to quickly scan patient information and determine whether or not the patient is high-risk or low-risk for surgical complications.</p>
                        <p>From our research, we realized that it took less than 10 seconds for each surgeon to scan the risk page.</p>
                        <p>The surgeons were only viewing the bottom section although the middle section was the most important and also the unique value proposition for Ready Surgery.</p>

                        <p> I decided to focus on two main problems: locating and deleting bookmarks. Using the information from the research, I created two personas that were typical of the users that I interviewed whom were mostly students or young professionals. Creating a persona allowed me to think in their shoes and implement changes in ways they see fit. I also created a scenario as that allowed me to fully immerse myself in a situation and think visually. </p>
